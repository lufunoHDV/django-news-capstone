Overview
This project is a Django-based News application. This README will guide you through how to set up and run the application using either a Python virtual environment (venv) or Docker.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.10 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

virtualenv (optional but recommended)

Docker (optional, if you want to run the app inside a container)

Running the Application Locally Using Python Virtual Environment (venv)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Create an isolated Python environment for the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Step 4: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 5: Set Up the Database
Make sure your database is running and configured in settings.py. For SQLite, no extra steps needed.

If using MySQL/PostgreSQL, ensure the database server is running and accessible.

Step 6: Apply Migrations
bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
Step 7: Run the Development Server
bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
Step 8: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Running the Application Using Docker
Step 1: Clone the Repository (if you havenâ€™t already)
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Step 2: Build the Docker Image
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t newsapp .
Step 3: Run the Docker Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name newsapp_container newsapp
Step 4: Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8000/
Additional Notes
To stop the Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop newsapp_container
To remove the Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker rm newsapp_container
If you make changes to your code and want to rebuild the Docker image, repeat Step 2 above.

Troubleshooting
If venv activation fails, ensure you are running the correct activation command for your operating system.

Make sure Docker is running before executing Docker commands.

For database errors, verify your database configuration in settings.py.
